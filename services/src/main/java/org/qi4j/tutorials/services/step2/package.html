<h1>Step 2 - Activatable</h1>
<p>
    Services can be "<i>activated</i>" and "<i>passivated</i>". Applicaitons can be notified of this occurring
    by Qi4j runtime calling the two methods <code>activate</code> and <code>passivate</code> of the
    <code>Activatable</code> interface implemented by any number of Mixin implementations. That means that unlike
    other methods in a composite all mixins implementing the method will be called.
</p>
<p>
    To showcase how this works, we refactor the code to create a number of copies of the books, to be lend out
    upon call to the <code>borrowBook</code> method, which will return null if no copy is available. The book
    copies are created in the <code>activate</code> method.
</p>
<p>
    Steps to do.
    <ol>
        <li>Make LibraryMixin implement the <code>org.qi4j.api.service.Activatable</code> interface.</li>
        <li>In the <code>activate</code> method, create a couple of books of each title and store each copy in a
            <code>HashMap&lt;String,ArrayList&lt;Book&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
    </ol>
