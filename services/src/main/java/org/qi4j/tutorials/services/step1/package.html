<h1>Tutorial 1 - Interface refactoring</h1>

In this tutorial we start with basic Java classes, to simulate a very simple Library where you can borrow
and return books.
<p/>
Qi4j relies heavily on the use of interfaces. This makes it possible for an object
to externally implement a number of interfaces which internally is backed by a number
of Mixins, some of which you may have written yourself, and some of which may have been
reused. This is also true for services, which we are to cover in this tutorial.
<p/>
The first task is therefore to refactor the code so that the methods are implemented from an
interface instead.
<p/>
Steps for this tutorial:
<ol>
    <li>Refactor the LibraryService and Book into interface and implementation.</li>
</ol>
