Description of TransientComposite tutorials.

<h2>TransientComposite tutorials</h2>

<p>
Throughout this set of tutorials it will be shown how to create and work with TransientComposites, which
is the basic element in Qi4j. We will refactor one HelloWorld class to take advantage of the various
features in Qi4j. These refactorings will make it easier to reuse parts of the class,
and introduce new features without having to change existing code. We will also look
at some of the existing classes, or Fragments, available in Qi4j that you can reuse
so that you don't have to write everything yourself.
</p>
<p>
The ambition of the TransientComposite tutorials is to show you the mechanics of the parts that make up a composite.
It is not the ambition to show why COP/Qi4j should be a superior way to solve this particular problem. Also, the tutorials
assume you are well familiar with Java, especially interfaces and annotations. These tutorials have no ambition to teach
Java or design in any broarder sense.
</p>
<p>
In other words: if you have got this far, we assume you are a seasoned Java programmer, who has heard enough about Qi4j
to want to try the tools. This set of tutorials will walk you through the most basic tools, showing you each, but will not
tell you the full story of which tool to apply exactly where and when.
</p>
<p>
Each tutorial in this series starts with the result from the previous tutorial, so you can
always look at the next tutorial step for guidance on what to do. Here are the steps:
