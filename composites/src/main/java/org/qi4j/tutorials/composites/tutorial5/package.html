<h1>Tutorial 5 - Constraints</h1>

In this tutorial we will look at how to use Constraints. When we pass parameters to
methods in regular Java code the only restriction we can make is to denote a type.
Any other constraints on the input value, such as non-null, integer ranges, string regular
expressions, and so on, cannot be expressed, and se we have to put this into Javadoc, and
then manually add these checks in the implementation class.
<p/>
In Qi4j there is the option to use Constraints, which are further restrictions on the parameters.
This is implemented by having an annotation that describes what the Constraint does, and then
an implementation class that checks whether a specific value fulfills the Constraint or not.
<p/>
There are a number of pre-written constraints in Qi4j which you can use, and checking for null
values is one of them. Since the HelloWorld code does this manually, let's replace it with the
Constraint to simplify the code and better document the interface so that clients know what is
expected.
<p/>
The only thing you have to do is add the annotation @NotNull to the method parameters you want to
constrain. The annotation has a default implementation declared in it by using the @Constraints
annotation. You can either just use this, which is the common case, or override it by declaring your
own @Constraints annotation in the Composite type.
<p/>
Steps for this tutorial:
<ol>
    <li>Add @NotNull to the state parameters</li>
    <li>Remove the manual parameter checks</li>
</ol>
