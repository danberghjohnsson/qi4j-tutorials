<h1>Step 1 - Evans "Making a booking."</h1>

<p>
    Location: Page 17, "Knowledge-Rich Design.
</p>

<p>
    We start with a very simple domain design, consisting of a <i>Voyage</i> with <i>Cargo</i> items.
    The booking system is responsible for matching as many <i>Cargo</i> items on to the <i>Voyage</i>
    but not too many. Evans introduces a <i>capacity</i> property in the Voyage and a <i>size</i>
    property to the Cargo.
</p>

<p>
    Mr Evans continues to discuss that a <i>makeBooking( Cargo cargo, Voyage voyage )</i> method
    (presumably in some service instance somewhere) becomes too complicated for the domain experts
    and suggests breaking out the <b>policy</b> into a separate class.
</p>

<p>
    Let's start with putting into the code that Mr Evans suggests, using so called POJO or JavaBeans
    programming convention.
</p>

<p>
    You will find the suggested code in this package. Take a look at it. You can also run the
    testcase <b>step1</b> to see simple usage cases.
</p>

<p>
    We have made this code more complex than the book is suggesting. First of all there is a separation
    of interface from implementation. This is done to make the code more flexible for future change;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <i>Voyage.addCargo()</i> <b>must</b> be hidden from the client code, so that it is forced to call
        the <i>ShippingService.makeBooking()</i> and not bypassing it and call the <i>addCargo()</i> directly.
    </li>
    <li>DDD book doesn't mention the <i>ShippingService</i> in this section, but was introduced to make the
        code executable. Making the ShippingService an interface is just following common practices, which
        allows us to change the, or have multiple, implementations.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cargo</i> also has separated interface from the implementation for the same reason.</li>
    <li><i>Sequence</i> is separated largely because in a real application, it is probably dependent on
        the customer.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, the <i>OverbookingPolicy</i> is also separated since we want to be able to have many Policies
        sooner or later.
    </li>
    <li>And with this separation, and hiding of the implementation from the client by putting all of the
        implementation details in the <i>internal</i> package, we also need to add methods to create <i>Cargo</i>
        and find <i>Voyage</i> instances.
    </li>
</ul>
